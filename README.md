# Data_Analytics

We imported the libraries such as pandas and pymysql.
Then the dataset was loaded, and top 1000 rows were extracted from the same.
Post which, a function was created which group by's a column and counts the number of rows of the grouped data. The output is the count of the grouped data in descending order.
Once the function is created, it is called and is returning the output in to a variable.
Once the function is called, we are able to see the desired result set.
